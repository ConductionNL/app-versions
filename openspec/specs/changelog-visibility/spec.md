# Changelog Visibility Specification

**Status**: implemented
**Standards**: Nextcloud App Store API v1 (release translations), GitHub REST API v2022-11-28 (release body), Forgejo/Codeberg API v1
**Feature tier**: MVP

## Purpose

Admins choosing a version to install — especially rolling back past intermediate releases — need to read what each release changed. Both bound source kinds already deliver release notes; this capability surfaces them in the version listing and aggregates them across the installed→target range. Rendering is fail-soft and sanitized; changelog availability never gates an install.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Version listings carry release notes [MVP]

`GET /api/app/{appId}/versions` MUST include a nullable `changelog` string per version. `AppStoreSource` MUST map the release's `translations` changelog (requested language, falling back to `en`); `ForgeReleaseSource` MUST map the release `body`. The server MUST truncate each changelog to at most 8 KiB (appending a truncation marker) and MUST return `null` when the source provides none. Changelog extraction failures MUST NOT fail or delay the version listing.

#### Scenario: Forge release body is returned

- GIVEN `openregister` is bound to `github:ConductionNL/openregister` and release 2.3.0 has a body "Fixes LDAP sync"
- WHEN the admin fetches `/api/app/openregister/versions`
- THEN the 2.3.0 entry MUST contain `changelog: "Fixes LDAP sync"`

#### Scenario: Missing notes are null, listing still works

- GIVEN a release without notes
- WHEN versions are fetched
- THEN that entry's `changelog` MUST be `null`
- AND the version listing MUST succeed with all other fields intact

#### Scenario: Oversized changelog is truncated server-side

- GIVEN a release whose notes exceed 8 KiB
- WHEN versions are fetched
- THEN the returned `changelog` MUST be at most 8 KiB plus a truncation marker

---

### Requirement: Per-version changelog display [MVP]

The version picker MUST let the admin expand any version row to read its release notes, rendered as sanitized text/markdown (raw HTML MUST NOT be injected into the DOM). Rows without notes MUST show a localized "No release notes provided".

#### Scenario: Expand a version row

@e2e tests/e2e/versions.spec.ts

- GIVEN the version list for `openregister` is displayed
- WHEN the admin expands the 2.3.0 row
- THEN its release notes MUST be shown, sanitized
- AND a row without notes MUST show "No release notes provided"

#### Scenario: Markdown is not an XSS vector

@e2e tests/e2e/versions.spec.ts

- GIVEN a release body containing `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- WHEN the row is expanded
- THEN the script MUST be rendered inert (escaped or stripped), never executed

---

### Requirement: Aggregate range changelog on target selection [MVP]

When the admin selects a target version different from the installed one, the UI MUST show an aggregate panel listing, per intermediate release in the range (installed, target], each version label and its notes (or the no-notes placeholder), ordered from installed towards the target — for downgrades this means the releases being rolled back, newest first. The aggregate MUST reuse the already-fetched listing (no extra requests per version).

#### Scenario: Upgrade range aggregation

- GIVEN `openregister` installed at 2.3.0 and target 2.5.0 selected, with releases 2.4.0 and 2.5.0 in between
- WHEN the aggregate panel renders
- THEN it MUST list 2.4.0 and 2.5.0 each with their notes

#### Scenario: Downgrade shows what is being undone

- GIVEN installed 2.5.0 and target 2.3.0
- WHEN the aggregate panel renders
- THEN it MUST list 2.5.0 and 2.4.0 (the releases rolled back), newest first
- AND the existing downgrade confirmation flow MUST remain unchanged
