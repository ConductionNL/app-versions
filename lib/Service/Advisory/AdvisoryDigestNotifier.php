/**
 * A weekly summary of advisories that are NOT urgent — apps with a security
 * history whose installed version is already safe.
 *
 * WHY A DIGEST RATHER THAN MORE NOTIFICATIONS. {@see AdvisoryNotifier} fires
 * immediately when an installed version is actually inside an affected range,
 * and that must stay rare enough to be read. Informational advisories are far
 * more numerous — the published feed averages several new records a month
 * across 53 packages — so notifying on each would train administrators to
 * dismiss the channel that carries the urgent ones.
 *
 * Like the urgent notifier, this class has NO dependency on any installer or
 * version-mutation service: it can only inform.
