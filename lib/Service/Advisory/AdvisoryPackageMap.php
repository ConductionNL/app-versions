/**
 * Resolves the package name in a Nextcloud security advisory to something this
 * instance can act on: an installed app id, the server itself, or nothing.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A ONE-LINER. The published feed names packages the way a
 * human would, not the way the instance does. Measured over the 27 distinct
 * packages in the live feed (2026-08-21):
 *
 *   Talk                  -> spreed              (id bears no resemblance)
 *   Team Folders          -> groupfolders        (the app was renamed)
 *   User OIDC             -> user_oidc
 *   user_oidc             -> user_oidc           (the SAME app, both spellings
 *                                                 appear in the same feed)
 *   Twofactor WebAuthn    -> twofactor_webauthn
 *   End-to-End Encryption -> end_to_end_encryption
 *
 * Normalising to lowercase alphanumerics collapses all of those, and matching
 * against BOTH the app id and the app's display name is what makes `Talk` find
 * `spreed` — the id never matches, the name does.
 *
 * INSTALLED APPS ARE INDEXED AS WELL AS THE STORE CATALOGUE, and that is not
 * redundant: apps bundled with the server are absent from the App Store
 * catalogue entirely. Measured, a catalogue-only index resolved 19 of 27
 * packages and missed `Photos` and `Flow` for exactly that reason.
 *
 * A name that resolves to nothing is DROPPED AND COUNTED, never guessed at. A
 * wrong match here either raises a false alarm on an app that is fine or,
 * worse, attaches a real advisory to the wrong app and leaves the affected one
 * looking clean.
