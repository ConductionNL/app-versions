/**
 * Decides whether an installed version is affected by an advisory, using the
 * advisory's list of PATCHED versions rather than its prose version range.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST EVALUATE THE RANGE. Nextcloud's published advisories describe
 * several parallel maintenance branches in a single record, and the range
 * field cannot express that. Measured over the 161 vulnerability entries in
 * the live `nextcloud/security-advisories` feed (2026-08-21):
 *
 *   66.5%  multiple lower bounds, no upper bound
 *          e.g. Mail  '>= 3.5.0, >= 3.7.0, >= 4.1.0, >= 4.3.0'
 *                     patched '3.7.25, 5.5.16, 5.6.20, 5.7.13'
 *   23.6%  a single lower bound, no upper bound
 *    5.0%  a single upper bound
 *    1.2%  several upper bounds
 *          e.g. Talk  '< 21.1.10, < 22.0.11, < 23.0.3'
 *                     patched '21.1.10, 22.0.11, 23.0.3'
 *
 * Neither boolean reading of that comma is right:
 *
 *   AND (the previous behaviour) collapses Mail's four clauses to '>= 4.3.0',
 *   so an instance on 3.6.0 is told it is SAFE. A false NEGATIVE, which is the
 *   worst direction a security check can fail in.
 *
 *   OR turns Talk's clauses into '< 23.0.3', so a correctly-patched 22.0.11 is
 *   reported VULNERABLE. A false positive, which trains admins to ignore the
 *   badge.
 *
 * The structure the data actually has is one patch per release branch. So the
 * branch decides:
 *
 *   - branch is `major.minor`;
 *   - if the installed version's OWN branch has a patch listed, that patch
 *     alone decides — at or above it means fixed, below it means affected;
 *   - only a branch with NO patch listed falls through to the nearest higher
 *     patch within the same major;
 *   - a version newer than every patch for its major is not affected.
 *
 * Validated against the whole corpus: 0 false positives in 458 probes (an
 * instance sitting exactly on a patched version), and 0 misses in 412 probes
 * (an instance one patch level below a patch). See BranchAwareRangeTest, which
 * re-runs both sweeps over the committed fixture.
