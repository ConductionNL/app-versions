 * Correlates the currently-installed/pinned version of each app against the

 * App Store security feed for store-sourced apps; the forge advisory endpoint
 * for external-sourced apps).
 *
 * The correlation is read-only: it never installs, unpins, or otherwise mutates
 * an app's version — Versioniq surfaces the advisory and the recommended
 * safe version, and the administrator decides. External fetches are delegated
 * to the source drivers (which reuse the existing PAT/credential path); this
 * service adds no HTTP client of its own.
 *
 * States (per app):
 *   - `pinned-to-vulnerable`: the installed/pinned version is itself within an
 *     advisory's affected range. This is the failure mode this tool can
 *     uniquely create (deliberate pinning to an older version) and is therefore
 *     the prominent, must-own state.
 *   - `advisory-available`: the installed version is NOT affected, but the
 *     source reports advisories for the app affecting other (older) versions —
 *     i.e. the app has a security history and the installed version is at or
 *     above the fix. Informational.
 *   - `none`: the source reports no advisories for the app.
